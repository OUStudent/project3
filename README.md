# project3

DETAILS: Simply just extract the test files '0-8.ins' into your local directory and run your program.
         The name of each folder are the command line arguments minus the algorithm name.
         For example, the folder 3_3_256 would be run with './project3 3 3 256 FIRSTFIT'. 
         Also note that a jpg has been supplied with the correct expected output to compare locally.
         
TEST CASES: All test cases from project3 are here except for TEST_LARGE_CASE (work in progress)
